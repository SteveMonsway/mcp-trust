## Findings (11)
### MEDIUM (4)
#### MCP-META-004: Metadata references system/developer prompt
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata references the system or developer prompt, a common prompt-injection target.

**Evidence:** `eval/simulators.py`

```
LLM-driven user simulator with a scripted goal.

    The simulator's system prompt is built from ``goal_steps`` (ordered list
    of tasks the user is trying to accomplish) and ``constraints`` (things
```

**Impact:** Instruction-like text in server-controlled metadata can steer the model without user awareness.

**Remediation:** Review why tool metadata references system-level prompts; treat as untrusted.

#### MCP-META-004: Metadata references system/developer prompt
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata references the system or developer prompt, a common prompt-injection target.

**Evidence:** `eval/simulators.py`

```
t need to re-read it; its goals
        # live in the system prompt.
        conversation = history[1:] if history else []
        flipped: list[dict[str, str]] = []
        for h in conversation:
   
```

**Impact:** Instruction-like text in server-controlled metadata can steer the model without user awareness.

**Remediation:** Review why tool metadata references system-level prompts; treat as untrusted.

#### MCP-SG-PY-004: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `eval/scenarios/full_flow.py:130`

```
requests.append({
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

#### MCP-SG-PY-004: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `eval/scenarios/two_agent_flow.py:125`

```
requests.append({
```

### LOW (7)
#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `eval/drivers/anthropic.py:46`

```
api_key = <redacted:secret>"LITELLM_API_KEY") or os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `eval/drivers/openai.py:40`

```
api_key = <redacted:secret>"LITELLM_API_KEY") or os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

```
os.environ["SIGNNOW_PASSWORD"] = "eval-password"  # noqa: S105
```

os.environ["SIGNNOW_API_BASIC_TOKEN"] = "eval-basic-token"  # noqa: S105
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.
