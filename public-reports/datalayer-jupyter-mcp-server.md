**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 44/100  
**Confidence:** 72%

_Resolved ref: `27b91e551d8bbca2da32c334f9f13267290ff815`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 44 falls in MEDIUM band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-CONFIG-005, MCP-CONFIG-005, MCP-CONFIG-005, MCP-CONFIG-005

## Findings (13)
### HIGH (4)
#### MCP-CONFIG-005: Secret embedded directly in MCP config
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 85%  **Category:** config

A config env value or header appears to contain a real secret rather than a runtime-injected reference.

**Evidence:** `.vscode/mcp.json`

```
DOCUMENT_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8888
```

**Impact:** Committed secrets can be leaked via source control, reports, or shared configs.

**Remediation:** Do not hardcode secrets in config. Inject them at runtime from a secrets manager or environment.

#### MCP-CONFIG-005: Secret embedded directly in MCP config
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 85%  **Category:** config

A config env value or header appears to contain a real secret rather than a runtime-injected reference.

**Evidence:** `.vscode/mcp.json`

```
RUNTIME_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8888
```

**Impact:** Committed secrets can be leaked via source control, reports, or shared configs.

**Remediation:** Do not hardcode secrets in config. Inject them at runtime from a secrets manager or environment.

#### MCP-CONFIG-005: Secret embedded directly in MCP config
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 65%  **Category:** config

A config env value or header appears to contain a real secret rather than a runtime-injected reference.

```
DOCUMENT_TOKEN=<redacted:secret>
```

**Impact:** Committed secrets can be leaked via source control, reports, or shared configs.

**Remediation:** Do not hardcode secrets in config. Inject them at runtime from a secrets manager or environment.

### MEDIUM (7)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `jupyter_mcp_server/tools/delete_cell_tool.py:96`

```
with open(notebook_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

### LOW (2)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — tests/conftest.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/conftest.py:72`

```
stderr_fh = open(stderr_file, "w")  # noqa: SIM115
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `examples/cli/agent.py:55`

```
mcp_token = <redacted:secret>"MCP_TOKEN", "MY_MCP_TOKEN")
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.


## Recommended Policy
- Run only in a sandbox with least-privilege configuration.
- Move secrets out of config into a secrets manager or environment injected at runtime.
