# MCP Trust Report: github:cso1z/Feishu-MCP

**Decision:** BLOCK  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 33/100  
**Confidence:** 72%

_Resolved ref: `ae620e2f76f4ec8a4e546ed10b1b0572f8e2f77d`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **high-confidence capability evidence in the server’s runtime code** (e.g. command execution). Review the flagged findings below before connecting this server to an agent. **A BLOCK is a "review required", not proof the server is malicious** — the evidence may be legitimate by design (see Decision Reasons).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 33 falls in MEDIUM band
- Critical finding with high confidence: MCP-CODE-001

## Findings (22)
### CRITICAL (1)
#### MCP-CODE-001: child_process.exec usage
**Severity:** critical  **Confidence:** 95%  **Category:** code

Uses child_process.exec(), which runs a command through a shell and is prone to command injection.

**Evidence:** `src/cli/commands/auth.ts:28`

```
exec(cmd, (err) => {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false, and validate against an allowlist.

### HIGH (1)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `src/utils/auth/legacyCacheMigration.ts:47`

```
fs.unlinkSync(oldPath);
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### MEDIUM (13)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `src/utils/auth/legacyCacheMigration.ts:46`

```
fs.writeFileSync(newPath, content, 'utf-8');
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-SG-JS-006: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

The server handles credentials; misuse or logging could leak them.

**Evidence:** `src/cli/commands/config.ts:68`

```
? maskValue('FEISHU_APP_SECRET', process.env.FEISHU_APP_SECRET) : '(未设置)',
```

**Impact:** The server handles credentials; misuse or logging could leak them.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

The server handles credentials; misuse or logging could leak them.

**Evidence:** `src/utils/config.ts:227`

```
serverConfig.bearerToken = <redacted:secret>
```

**Impact:** The server handles credentials; misuse or logging could leak them.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `src/modules/document/services/FeishuBlockService.ts:457`

```
const response = await axios.get(imagePathOrUrl, { responseType: 'arraybuffer', timeout: 30000 });
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### LOW (6)
#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — src/cli.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/cli.test.ts:13`

```
const result = spawnSync(process.execPath, [cliPath, versionFlag], {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — src/cli.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/cli.test.ts:25`

```
const result = spawnSync(process.execPath, ['dist/cli.js', '--help'], {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `src/cli/commands/config.ts:67`

```
FEISHU_APP_SECRET: <redacted:secret>
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

### INFO (1)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-005: No security policy (SECURITY.md) found
**Severity:** info  **Confidence:** 100%  **Category:** supply_chain

The project does not provide a security policy. This is a maturity/best-practice gap, not a vulnerability — reported informational so it never drives the decision.

**Evidence:** `repo.files`

```
no SECURITY.md found in source
```

**Impact:** Absence of a disclosure process slows remediation of future vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:** Prefer projects that publish a SECURITY.md with a vulnerability disclosure process.


## Recommended Policy
- Block by default; do not connect to developer workstations or production agents without review.
