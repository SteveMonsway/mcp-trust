## Findings (45)
### HIGH (1)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `src/models/taskModel.ts:65`

```
await fs.writeFile(path.join(dataDir, '.gitignore'), gitignore);
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### MEDIUM (38)
#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — tools/task-viewer/cli.js — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tools/task-viewer/cli.js:67`

```
const child = spawn('node', [serverPath], {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 85%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — tools/task-viewer/server-vanilla.js — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tools/task-viewer/server-vanilla.js:1159`

```
await fs.unlink(agent.path);
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-003: Dynamic code evaluation (eval / Function)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 85%  **Category:** code

Uses eval() or the Function constructor to execute dynamically constructed code. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — tools/task-viewer/test-integration.js — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tools/task-viewer/test-integration.js:113`

```
const activeTab = await page.$eval('.tab.active', el => el.textContent);
```

**Impact:** Dynamically evaluated code can execute attacker-controlled logic.

**Remediation:** Remove eval/Function. Parse data with JSON.parse and use explicit dispatch tables.

#### MCP-CODE-003: Dynamic code evaluation (eval / Function)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 85%  **Category:** code

Uses eval() or the Function constructor to execute dynamically constructed code. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — tools/task-viewer/test-language-features.js — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

```

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

### LOW (5)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — tools/task-viewer/test/template-custom.test.js — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tools/task-viewer/test/template-custom.test.js:355`

```
await fs.writeFile(path.join(mockTemplatesDir, `${templateName}.txt`), content);
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `tools/task-viewer/server.js:1509`

```
let openAIKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || process.env.OPEN_AI_KEY_SHRIMP_TASK_VIEWER;
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

### INFO (1)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-005: No security policy (SECURITY.md) found
**Severity:** info  **Confidence:** 100%  **Category:** supply_chain

The project does not provide a security policy. This is a maturity/best-practice gap, not a vulnerability — reported informational so it never drives the decision.

**Evidence:** `repo.files`

```
no SECURITY.md found in source
```

**Impact:** Absence of a disclosure process slows remediation of future vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:** Prefer projects that publish a SECURITY.md with a vulnerability disclosure process.
