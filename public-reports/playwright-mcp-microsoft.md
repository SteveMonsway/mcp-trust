**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 33/100  
**Confidence:** 83%

_Resolved ref: `36ec986b8b1fc6b4d11f2b6971147755e1b0bc84`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 33 falls in MEDIUM band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002

## Findings (12)
### HIGH (6)
#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `roll.js:34`

```
execSync('npm install', { cwd: __dirname, stdio: 'inherit' });
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `roll.js:41`

```
execSync('npm run lint', { cwd: __dirname, stdio: 'inherit' });
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `roll.js:46`

```
version = execSync('npm info playwright@next version', { encoding: 'utf-8' }).trim();
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `update-readme.js:161`

```
execSync('node cli.js --help > help.txt');
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `update-readme.js:163`

```
fs.unlinkSync('help.txt');
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `roll.js:30`

```
fs.writeFileSync(file, JSON.stringify(json, null, 2) + '\n');
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### MEDIUM (2)
#### MCP-CODE-005: Arbitrary filesystem read
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Reads files using a dynamically constructed path, allowing reads outside the intended scope.

**Evidence:** `roll.js:19`

```
const json = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf-8'));
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled path can read sensitive files via path traversal. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Resolve and validate paths against an allowlisted base directory before reading.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `roll.js:13`

```
fs.writeFileSync(dst, content);
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### LOW (4)
#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 95%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously. (Severity reduced critical→low: this match is in test code — tests/cli.spec.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/cli.spec.ts:23`

```
const output = child_process.execSync(`node ${cliPath} install-browser --help`, { encoding: 'utf-8' });
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 95%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously. (Severity reduced critical→low: this match is in test code — tests/library.spec.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/library.spec.ts:27`

```
expect(child_process.execSync(`node ${file}`, { encoding: 'utf-8' })).toContain('OK');
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-005: Arbitrary filesystem read
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Reads files using a dynamically constructed path, allowing reads outside the intended scope. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — tests/fixtures.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/fixtures.ts:274`

```
snapshot = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(cwd, match[1]), 'utf-8');
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled path can read sensitive files via path traversal. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Resolve and validate paths against an allowlisted base directory before reading.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — tests/library.spec.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/library.spec.ts:22`

```
await fs.writeFile(file, `
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.
