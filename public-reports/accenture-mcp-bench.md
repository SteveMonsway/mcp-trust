## Findings (153)
### HIGH (15)
#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

#### MCP-SG-PY-004: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — mcp_servers/weather_mcp/test_mcp_server.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `mcp_servers/weather_mcp/test_mcp_server.py:19`

```
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, timeout=10)
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.
