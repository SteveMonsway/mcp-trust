_Resolved ref: `fd4524da66454d416181eca0f29cac71cc5ec082`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 26 falls in LOW band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002

## Findings (14)
### HIGH (1)
#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Evidence:** `src/index.ts:196`

```
const child = spawn(
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

### MEDIUM (4)
#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — src/tools/browser-eval.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/tools/browser-eval.ts:41`

```
const resolved = execSync(probe, { stdio: "pipe" }).toString().trim()
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — src/tools/browser-eval.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/tools/browser-eval.ts:49`

```
version = execSync("agent-browser --version", { stdio: "pipe" })
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `src/_internal/nextjs-runtime-manager.ts:73`

```
const response = await fetch(url, {
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `src/_internal/nextjs-runtime-manager.ts:317`

```
const response = await fetch(url, {
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### LOW (8)
#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 95%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously. (Severity reduced critical→low: this match is in test code — test/unit/nextjs-runtime-discovery.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `test/unit/nextjs-runtime-discovery.test.ts:18`

```
execSync(`taskkill /pid ${proc.pid} /T /F`, { stdio: "ignore" })
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

**Evidence:** `test/unit/nextjs-runtime-discovery.test.ts:32`

```
execSync(`taskkill /pid ${proc.pid} /T /F`, { stdio: "ignore" })
```

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — test/e2e/mcp-registration.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `test/e2e/mcp-registration.test.ts:79`

```
execSync("pnpm build", { cwd: REPO_ROOT, stdio: "inherit" })
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — test/e2e/telemetry-tracking.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `test/e2e/telemetry-tracking.test.ts:67`

```
execSync("pnpm build", { cwd: REPO_ROOT, stdio: "inherit" })
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — test/unit/nextjs-docs-gateway.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `test/unit/nextjs-docs-gateway.test.ts:43`

```
if (tmpDir) fs.rmSync(tmpDir, { recursive: true, force: true })
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — test/unit/nextjs-docs-gateway.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `test/unit/nextjs-docs-gateway.test.ts:31`

```
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(docsDir, "index.md"), "# docs")
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

**Evidence:** `test/unit/nextjs-docs-gateway.test.ts:24`

```
fs.writeFileSync(
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### INFO (1)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-005: No security policy (SECURITY.md) found
**Severity:** info  **Confidence:** 100%  **Category:** supply_chain

The project does not provide a security policy. This is a maturity/best-practice gap, not a vulnerability — reported informational so it never drives the decision.

**Evidence:** `repo.files`

```
no SECURITY.md found in source
```

**Impact:** Absence of a disclosure process slows remediation of future vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:** Prefer projects that publish a SECURITY.md with a vulnerability disclosure process.
