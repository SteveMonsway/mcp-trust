# MCP Trust Report: github:hangwin/mcp-chrome

**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 37/100  
**Confidence:** 71%

_Resolved ref: `f48e71751e00bc09725c7e173423cff4f2ccd12a`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Additionally, Rust source is present but was NOT analyzed — MCP Trust has code rules for JavaScript, TypeScript and Python only. Absence of code findings does not imply this server is safe.

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 37 falls in MEDIUM band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `app/chrome-extension/utils/image-utils.ts:11`

```
const response = await fetch(dataUrl);
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### LOW (1)
#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `app/native-server/src/agent/ccr-detector.ts:135`

```
const envAuthToken = <redacted:secret>
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

### INFO (1)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-005: No security policy (SECURITY.md) found
**Severity:** info  **Confidence:** 100%  **Category:** supply_chain

The project does not provide a security policy. This is a maturity/best-practice gap, not a vulnerability — reported informational so it never drives the decision.

**Evidence:** `repo.files`

```
no SECURITY.md found in source
```

**Impact:** Absence of a disclosure process slows remediation of future vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:** Prefer projects that publish a SECURITY.md with a vulnerability disclosure process.
