**Impact:** Instruction-like text in server-controlled metadata can steer the model without user awareness.

**Remediation:** Any instruction to hide behavior from the user is a strong tool-poisoning signal; do not connect without review.

**Impact:** Instruction-like text in server-controlled metadata can steer the model without user awareness.

**Remediation:** Any instruction to hide behavior from the user is a strong tool-poisoning signal; do not connect without review.
