## Findings (14)
### MEDIUM (6)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `scripts/update-version.js:31`

```
fs.writeFileSync(versionPath, content);
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `scripts/update-version.js:44`

```
fs.writeFileSync(serverJsonPath, JSON.stringify(serverJson, null, 2) + '\n');
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-SG-JS-002: Dynamic module load (require with non-literal path)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled module path can load and execute arbitrary code.

**Evidence:** `scripts/update-version.js:41`

```
const serverJson = require(serverJsonPath);
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled module path can load and execute arbitrary code.

**Remediation:** Require modules by static string literals; never require a computed path.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `src/instance-info.ts:272`

```
const response = await fetch(requestUrl.toString(), requestOptions);
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### LOW (8)
#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — __tests__/e2e/helpers/spawn-server.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `__tests__/e2e/helpers/spawn-server.ts:60`

```
const result = spawnSync('node', [DIST_CLI], {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — __tests__/integration/cli.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `__tests__/integration/cli.test.ts:29`

```
const result = spawnSync(
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — __tests__/integration/index.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `__tests__/integration/index.test.ts:210`

```
const result = spawnSync(
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

**Evidence:** `__tests__/integration/index.test.ts:245`

```
const result = spawnSync(
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `src/error-handler.ts:191`

```
const authPassword = <redacted:secret>
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

**Evidence:** `src/http-security.ts:43`
