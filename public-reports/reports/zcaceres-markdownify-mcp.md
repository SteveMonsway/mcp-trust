# MCP Trust Report: github:zcaceres/markdownify-mcp

**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 43/100  
**Confidence:** 81%

_Resolved ref: `024f97cea9a94cd842c445eea4503c442c79bd71`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 43 falls in MEDIUM band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002

## Findings (14)
### HIGH (3)
#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `preinstall.js:4`

```
execSync('setup.bat', { stdio: 'inherit' });
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `preinstall.js:6`

```
execSync('./setup.sh', { stdio: 'inherit' });
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `src/Markdownify.ts:140`

```
fs.unlinkSync(inputPath);
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### MEDIUM (3)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-003: Install script present in package
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** supply_chain

The package declares install/preinstall/postinstall scripts that run automatically on install.

**Evidence:** `package.scripts.preinstall`

```
preinstall: node preinstall.js
```

**Impact:** Install scripts execute code on the developer/CI machine at install time.

**Remediation:** Review install scripts; install with --ignore-scripts where possible and vet what they do.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `src/Markdownify.ts:79`

```
fs.writeFileSync(tempOutputPath, content);
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `src/Markdownify.ts:90`

```
const response = await fetch(currentUrl, { redirect: "manual" });
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### LOW (7)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 85%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — src/Markdownify.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/Markdownify.test.ts:22`

```
fs.unlinkSync(path.join(tempDir, file));
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — src/Markdownify.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/Markdownify.test.ts:96`

```
fs.unlinkSync(tempFilePath);
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — src/utils.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/utils.test.ts:236`

```
fs.rmSync(tmp, { recursive: true, force: true });
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

**Evidence:** `src/utils.test.ts:254`

```
fs.rmSync(tmp, { recursive: true, force: true });
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — src/utils.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/utils.test.ts:278`

```
fs.rmSync(tmp, { recursive: true, force: true });
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — src/Markdownify.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/Markdownify.test.ts:88`

```
fs.writeFileSync(tempFilePath, mdContent);
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — src/utils.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/utils.test.ts:250`

```
fs.writeFileSync(expected, "");
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### INFO (1)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-005: No security policy (SECURITY.md) found
**Severity:** info  **Confidence:** 100%  **Category:** supply_chain

The project does not provide a security policy. This is a maturity/best-practice gap, not a vulnerability — reported informational so it never drives the decision.

**Evidence:** `repo.files`

```
no SECURITY.md found in source
```

**Impact:** Absence of a disclosure process slows remediation of future vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:** Prefer projects that publish a SECURITY.md with a vulnerability disclosure process.
