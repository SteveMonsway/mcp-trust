# MCP Trust Report: github:nutriandrea/adobe-indesign-mcp

**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 33/100  
**Confidence:** 90%

_Resolved ref: `d0d6f499a15f547b9a71cf5d60ebec19b2a012d0`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 33 falls in MEDIUM band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002

## Findings (6)
### HIGH (3)
#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `bridge-proxy.mjs:48`

```
const result = execSync(
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `build-portfolio.mjs:8`

```
try { execSync("lsof -ti :8120 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null", { stdio: "ignore" }); } catch {}
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-003: Dynamic code evaluation (eval / Function)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses eval() or the Function constructor to execute dynamically constructed code.

**Evidence:** `src/bridge/jsonPolyfill.ts:39`

```
return eval('(' + text + ')');
```

**Impact:** Dynamically evaluated code can execute attacker-controlled logic. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Remove eval/Function. Parse data with JSON.parse and use explicit dispatch tables.

### LOW (2)
#### MCP-META-005: Encoded or hidden content in metadata
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 65%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata contains zero-width/bidi control characters or long encoded payloads that can hide instructions. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — tests/unit/handlerTypes.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/unit/handlerTypes.test.ts`

```
<redacted:high-entropy>==
```

**Impact:** Hidden or encoded content can smuggle instructions past human review.

**Remediation:** Strip and inspect hidden/encoded content. Reject metadata containing zero-width or bidi control characters.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `src/server/IndesignMcpServer.ts:134`

```
const token = <redacted:secret> || process.env.BRIDGE_TOKEN || '';
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

### INFO (1)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-005: No security policy (SECURITY.md) found
**Severity:** info  **Confidence:** 100%  **Category:** supply_chain

The project does not provide a security policy. This is a maturity/best-practice gap, not a vulnerability — reported informational so it never drives the decision.

**Evidence:** `repo.files`

```
no SECURITY.md found in source
```

**Impact:** Absence of a disclosure process slows remediation of future vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:** Prefer projects that publish a SECURITY.md with a vulnerability disclosure process.


## Recommended Policy
- Run only in a sandbox with least-privilege configuration.
