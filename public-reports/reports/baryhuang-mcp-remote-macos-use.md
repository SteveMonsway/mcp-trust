# MCP Trust Report: github:baryhuang/mcp-remote-macos-use

**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** LOW  
**Score:** 23/100  
**Confidence:** 60%

_Resolved ref: `58c13c785ce76ad1d37975e9b7aa32303b8d7c22`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 23 falls in LOW band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-META-003

## Findings (8)
### HIGH (1)
#### MCP-META-003: Suspicious data-exfiltration phrase in metadata
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata references sending data/credentials to an external destination.

**Evidence:** `src/mcp_remote_macos_use/livekit_handler.py`

```
Send data to all participants in the room
```

**Impact:** Instruction-like text in server-controlled metadata can steer the model without user awareness.

**Remediation:** Investigate where data would be sent. Block until the destination and intent are verified.

### LOW (7)
#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `src/action_handlers.py:25`

```
MACOS_PASSWORD = <redacted:secret>'MACOS_PASSWORD', '')
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `src/mcp_remote_macos_use/server.py:56`

```
MACOS_PASSWORD = <redacted:secret>'MACOS_PASSWORD', '')
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `src/mcp_remote_macos_use/server.py:61`

```
LIVEKIT_API_KEY = <redacted:secret>'LIVEKIT_API_KEY', '')
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `src/mcp_remote_macos_use/server.py:62`

```
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET = <redacted:secret>'LIVEKIT_API_SECRET', '')
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `tests/conftest.py:49`

```
os.environ['MACOS_PASSWORD'] = 'test-password'
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-SG-PY-006: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Evidence:** `src/mcp_remote_macos_use/livekit_handler.py:16`

```
self.api_key = <redacted:secret>'LIVEKIT_API_KEY')
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-SG-PY-006: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Evidence:** `src/mcp_remote_macos_use/livekit_handler.py:17`

```
self.api_secret = <redacted:secret>'LIVEKIT_API_SECRET')
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.
