# MCP Trust Report: github:Azure-Samples/mcp-agent-langchainjs

**Decision:** APPROVE  
**Risk:** LOW  
**Score:** 22/100  
**Confidence:** 65%

_Resolved ref: `8c376a282080793a0802539efdb18bc0aadb3647`_

## Executive Summary
No significant risks were detected in the available evidence. **This is not a safety guarantee** — standard review still applies, and see Coverage/Limitations for what was and wasn’t assessed.

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 22 falls in LOW band

## Findings (7)
### MEDIUM (4)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `packages/agent-api/src/fs-history.ts:130`

```
await fs.writeFile(this.filePath, JSON.stringify(store));
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `packages/agent-cli/agent-cli.ts:112`

```
await fs.writeFile(sessionPath, JSON.stringify(session, null, 2));
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `packages/burger-mcp/src/mcp.ts:173`

```
const response = await fetch(fullUrl, {
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `packages/burger-webapp/src/orders.service.ts:31`

```
const response = await fetch(url);
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### LOW (3)
#### MCP-CODE-003: Dynamic code evaluation (eval / Function)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 85%  **Category:** code

Uses eval() or the Function constructor to execute dynamically constructed code. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in documentation code — docs/workshop/slides/template/code.js — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `docs/workshop/slides/template/code.js:13`

```
eval(node.innerHTML);
```

**Impact:** Dynamically evaluated code can execute attacker-controlled logic.

**Remediation:** Remove eval/Function. Parse data with JSON.parse and use explicit dispatch tables.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `packages/agent-api/src/functions/chats-post.ts:101`

```
apiKey: <redacted:secret> ?? getAzureOpenAiTokenProvider(),
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `packages/beer-mcp/src/config.ts:11`

```
export const azureOpenAiApiKey = <redacted:secret>
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.
