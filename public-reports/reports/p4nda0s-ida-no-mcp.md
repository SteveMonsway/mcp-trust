## Findings (12)
### HIGH (3)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 85%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `INP.py:296`

```
os.remove(path)
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `INP.py:844`

```
with open(path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `INP.py:1828`

```
self._str_f = open(path, 'w', encoding='utf-8')
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### MEDIUM (9)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `INP.py:231`

```
with open(progress_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.
