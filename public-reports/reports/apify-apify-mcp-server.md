## Findings (23)
### HIGH (1)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `src/web/build.js:96`

```
await fs.rm(distPath, { recursive: true, force: true });
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### MEDIUM (6)
#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — scripts/dev_standby.js — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `scripts/dev_standby.js:16`

```
const child = spawn(cmd, args, {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-CODE-005: Arbitrary filesystem read
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Reads files using a dynamically constructed path, allowing reads outside the intended scope.

**Evidence:** `src/web/build.js:27`

```
const cssContent = await fs.readFile(args.path, 'utf8');
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled path can read sensitive files via path traversal. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Resolve and validate paths against an allowlisted base directory before reading.

#### MCP-SG-JS-006: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

The server handles credentials; misuse or logging could leak them.

**Evidence:** `evals/shared/config.ts:21`

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY: <redacted:secret>,
```

**Impact:** The server handles credentials; misuse or logging could leak them.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-META-004: Metadata references system/developer prompt
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata references the system or developer prompt, a common prompt-injection target.

**Evidence:** `evals/workflows/conversation_executor.ts`

```
s initial prompt */
    userPrompt: string;
    /** MCP client for tool execution and dynamic tool fetching */
    mcpClient: McpClient;
    /** LLM client for chat completions */
    llmClient: LlmCl
```

**Impact:** Instruction-like text in server-controlled metadata can steer the model without user awareness.

**Remediation:** Review why tool metadata references system-level prompts; treat as untrusted.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `src/mcp/client.ts:93`

```
return fetch(input, { ...init, headers });
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

**Evidence:** `src/payments/x402.ts:136`

```
const response = await fetch(url, {
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### LOW (15)
#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `evals/config.ts:206`

```
PHOENIX_API_KEY: <redacted:secret>,
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in documentation code — src/tools/docs/fetch_apify_docs.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/tools/docs/fetch_apify_docs.ts:110`

```

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### INFO (1)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-005: No security policy (SECURITY.md) found
**Severity:** info  **Confidence:** 100%  **Category:** supply_chain

The project does not provide a security policy. This is a maturity/best-practice gap, not a vulnerability — reported informational so it never drives the decision.

**Evidence:** `repo.files`

```
no SECURITY.md found in source
```

**Impact:** Absence of a disclosure process slows remediation of future vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:** Prefer projects that publish a SECURITY.md with a vulnerability disclosure process.
