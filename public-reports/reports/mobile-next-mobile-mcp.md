### LOW (1)
#### MCP-META-005: Encoded or hidden content in metadata
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 65%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata contains zero-width/bidi control characters or long encoded payloads that can hide instructions. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — test/png.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `test/png.ts`

```
<redacted:high-entropy>=
```

**Impact:** Hidden or encoded content can smuggle instructions past human review.

**Remediation:** Strip and inspect hidden/encoded content. Reject metadata containing zero-width or bidi control characters.
