## Findings (6)
### LOW (6)
#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `src/utils.py:39`

```
if llm_api_key and not os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `src/utils.py:44`

```
os.environ["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"] = llm_api_key
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-SG-PY-006: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Evidence:** `src/utils.py:20`

```
llm_api_key = <redacted:secret>'LLM_API_KEY')
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-SG-PY-006: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Evidence:** `src/utils.py:40`

```
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = llm_api_key
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.
