# MCP Trust Report: github:minhalvp/android-mcp-server

**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 32/100  
**Confidence:** 90%

_Resolved ref: `451d255a7305e6efef8a1a2b7374a21c512bba45`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 32 falls in MEDIUM band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-CODE-004

## Findings (15)
### HIGH (1)
#### MCP-CODE-004: Python shell execution (subprocess shell=True / os.system)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Runs a subprocess through a shell (shell=True) or via os.system, enabling command injection.

**Evidence:** `run_tests.py:21`

```
result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True,
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use subprocess with a list of arguments and shell=False; never pass untrusted input to a shell.

### LOW (14)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — tests/test_config.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/test_config.py:193`

```
os.remove(self.config_file)
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — tests/test_integration.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/test_integration.py:194`

```
os.remove(self.config_file)
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — tests/test_config.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/test_config.py:71`

```
with open(self.config_file, 'w') as f:
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.
