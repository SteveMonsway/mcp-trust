## Findings (57)
### HIGH (8)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 85%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `src/auth/token-migration.ts:45`

```
fs.unlink(path.join(configDir, file)).catch((err) => {
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `src/config.ts:317`

```
JWT_SECRET: <redacted:secret>,
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — src/auth/server.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/auth/server.test.ts:52`

```
const req = http.get(url, (res) => {
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### INFO (1)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-005: No security policy (SECURITY.md) found
**Severity:** info  **Confidence:** 100%  **Category:** supply_chain

The project does not provide a security policy. This is a maturity/best-practice gap, not a vulnerability — reported informational so it never drives the decision.

**Evidence:** `repo.files`

```
no SECURITY.md found in source
```

**Impact:** Absence of a disclosure process slows remediation of future vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:** Prefer projects that publish a SECURITY.md with a vulnerability disclosure process.


## Recommended Policy
- Run only in a sandbox with least-privilege configuration.
