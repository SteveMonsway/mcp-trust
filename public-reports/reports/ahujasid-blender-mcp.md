## Findings (37)
### HIGH (13)
#### MCP-SG-PY-002: Dynamic code evaluation (eval / exec)

### MEDIUM (24)
#### MCP-CODE-005: Arbitrary filesystem read

Reads files using a dynamically constructed path, allowing reads outside the intended scope.

**Evidence:** `src/blender_mcp/server.py:913`

```
with open(path, "rb") as f:
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled path can read sensitive files via path traversal. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `addon.py:831`

```
with open(include_file_path, "wb") as f:
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-SG-PY-004: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.
