# MCP Trust Report: github:Minidoracat/mcp-feedback-enhanced

**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 34/100  
**Confidence:** 70%

**Source:** [github.com/Minidoracat/mcp-feedback-enhanced](https://github.com/Minidoracat/mcp-feedback-enhanced)

_Resolved ref: `541ca1e5db8f5d1357d856f163feaacda1eb7144`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Additionally, Rust source is present but was NOT analyzed — MCP Trust has code rules for JavaScript, TypeScript and Python only. Absence of code findings does not imply this server is safe.

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 34 falls in MEDIUM band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-CODE-004

## Findings (29)
### HIGH (2)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `src/mcp_feedback_enhanced/utils/resource_manager.py:378`

```
os.remove(file_path)
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `src/mcp_feedback_enhanced/utils/resource_manager.py:414`

```
shutil.rmtree(dir_path)
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### MEDIUM (18)
#### MCP-CODE-004: Python shell execution (subprocess shell=True / os.system)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Runs a subprocess through a shell (shell=True) or via os.system, enabling command injection. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — scripts/release.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `scripts/release.py:19`

```
result = subprocess.run(
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use subprocess with a list of arguments and shell=False; never pass untrusted input to a shell.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.
