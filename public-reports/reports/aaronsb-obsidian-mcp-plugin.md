# MCP Trust Report: github:aaronsb/obsidian-mcp-plugin

**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 37/100  
**Confidence:** 74%

_Resolved ref: `2349a2b13d992476a9a273d08bdaefe8bd3d9c65`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 37 falls in MEDIUM band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-CODE-002

## Findings (12)
### HIGH (2)
#### MCP-CODE-003: Dynamic code evaluation (eval / Function)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses eval() or the Function constructor to execute dynamically constructed code.

**Evidence:** `src/utils/expression-evaluator.ts:98`

```
// Parse with expression-eval (jsep grammar — no `eval`/`Function`/`new`
```

**Impact:** Dynamically evaluated code can execute attacker-controlled logic. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Remove eval/Function. Parse data with JSON.parse and use explicit dispatch tables.

#### MCP-META-002: Suspicious concealment phrase in metadata
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata instructs the model to hide actions from the user (e.g. "do not tell the user", "silently").

**Evidence:** `src/formatters/dataview.ts`

```
s group
  // predicate rather than silently leaking a wrapper if an unflattened group
  // ever reaches it (PR #249 review, F2).
  if (Array.isArray(inner)) {
    return { key: obj.key, rows: inner as
```

**Impact:** Instruction-like text in server-controlled metadata can steer the model without user awareness.

**Remediation:** Any instruction to hide behavior from the user is a strong tool-poisoning signal; do not connect without review.

### MEDIUM (7)
#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 95%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously. (Severity reduced critical→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — scripts/scorecard.mjs — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `scripts/scorecard.mjs:89`

```
return execSync(cmd, { stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'ignore'] }).toString().trim();
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — scripts/scorecard-baseline.mjs — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `scripts/scorecard-baseline.mjs:16`

```
const run = spawnSync(process.execPath, ['scripts/scorecard.mjs', '--json'], {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — scripts/scorecard-gate.mjs — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `scripts/scorecard-gate.mjs:51`

```
const run = spawnSync(process.execPath, ['scripts/scorecard.mjs', '--json'], {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `mcpb/server.js:67`

```
const response = await fetch(MCP_URL, {
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

```

```

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `test-concurrent.js:81`

```
const req = http.request(options, (res) => {
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### LOW (3)
#### MCP-META-005: Encoded or hidden content in metadata
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 65%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata contains zero-width/bidi control characters or long encoded payloads that can hide instructions. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — tests/recursive-copy.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/recursive-copy.test.ts`

```
data:image/png;base64,<redacted:high-entropy>==
```

**Impact:** Hidden or encoded content can smuggle instructions past human review.

**Remediation:** Strip and inspect hidden/encoded content. Reject metadata containing zero-width or bidi control characters.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `mcpb/server.js:7`

```
const API_KEY = <redacted:secret> || '';
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `tests/bridge-self-heal.test.ts:21`

```
process.env.MCP_API_KEY = '<redacted:secret>';
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.
