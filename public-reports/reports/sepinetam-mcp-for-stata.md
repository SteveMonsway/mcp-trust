**Decision:** BLOCK  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 42/100  
**Confidence:** 78%

**Source:** [github.com/SepineTam/mcp-for-stata](https://github.com/SepineTam/mcp-for-stata)

_Resolved ref: `e8a9ea23756e7f325a370b8801f77a38d544d30a`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **high-confidence capability evidence in the server’s runtime code** (e.g. command execution). Review the flagged findings below before connecting this server to an agent. **A BLOCK is a "review required", not proof the server is malicious** — the evidence may be legitimate by design (see Decision Reasons).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 42 falls in MEDIUM band
- Critical finding with high confidence: MCP-CODE-004

## Findings (26)
### CRITICAL (1)
#### MCP-CODE-004: Python shell execution (subprocess shell=True / os.system)
**Severity:** critical  **Confidence:** 95%  **Category:** code

Runs a subprocess through a shell (shell=True) or via os.system, enabling command injection.

**Evidence:** `src/stata_mcp/utils/usable.py:102`

```
result = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, timeout=10)
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Use subprocess with a list of arguments and shell=False; never pass untrusted input to a shell.

### HIGH (4)
#### MCP-CODE-004: Python shell execution (subprocess shell=True / os.system)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Runs a subprocess through a shell (shell=True) or via os.system, enabling command injection.

**Evidence:** `src/stata_mcp/stata/stata_do/do.py:314`

```
result = subprocess.run(
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use subprocess with a list of arguments and shell=False; never pass untrusted input to a shell.

#### MCP-CODE-004: Python shell execution (subprocess shell=True / os.system)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Runs a subprocess through a shell (shell=True) or via os.system, enabling command injection.

**Evidence:** `src/stata_mcp/stata/stata_do/do.py:465`

```
proc = subprocess.Popen(
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use subprocess with a list of arguments and shell=False; never pass untrusted input to a shell.

#### MCP-CODE-004: Python shell execution (subprocess shell=True / os.system)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Runs a subprocess through a shell (shell=True) or via os.system, enabling command injection.

**Evidence:** `src/stata_mcp/utils/doctor.py:356`

```
win_result = subprocess.run(
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use subprocess with a list of arguments and shell=False; never pass untrusted input to a shell.

#### MCP-CODE-004: Python shell execution (subprocess shell=True / os.system)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Runs a subprocess through a shell (shell=True) or via os.system, enabling command injection.

**Evidence:** `src/stata_mcp/utils/usable.py:74`

```
proc = subprocess.Popen(
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use subprocess with a list of arguments and shell=False; never pass untrusted input to a shell.

### MEDIUM (20)
#### MCP-CONFIG-001: Unpinned package version in MCP startup command
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** config

The startup command runs a package via npx/uvx without pinning an exact version, so the code executed can change silently between runs.

**Evidence:** `.mcp.json`

```
npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp --api-key ${CONTEXT7_API_KEY}
```

**Impact:** The exact code run at startup is not reproducible and can be replaced by a malicious release.

**Remediation:** Pin an exact version, e.g. `npx -y @scope/server@1.2.3`. Avoid `latest`/floating ranges in startup commands.

#### MCP-CONFIG-001: Unpinned package version in MCP startup command
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** config

The startup command runs a package via npx/uvx without pinning an exact version, so the code executed can change silently between runs.

**Evidence:** `.mcp.json`

```
uvx mineru-open-mcp
```

**Impact:** The exact code run at startup is not reproducible and can be replaced by a malicious release.

**Remediation:** Pin an exact version, e.g. `npx -y @scope/server@1.2.3`. Avoid `latest`/floating ranges in startup commands.

#### MCP-CONFIG-001: Unpinned package version in MCP startup command
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** config

The startup command runs a package via npx/uvx without pinning an exact version, so the code executed can change silently between runs.

**Evidence:** `plugins/stata-toolbox/mcp.json`

```
uvx stata-mcp
```

**Impact:** The exact code run at startup is not reproducible and can be replaced by a malicious release.

**Remediation:** Pin an exact version, e.g. `npx -y @scope/server@1.2.3`. Avoid `latest`/floating ranges in startup commands.

#### MCP-CODE-005: Arbitrary filesystem read

```
with open(path, "r", encoding=encoding) as file:
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled path can read sensitive files via path traversal. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Evidence:** `src/stata_mcp/utils/doctor.py:198`

```
__import__(package)
```

#### MCP-SG-PY-004: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `src/stata_mcp/data_info/base.py:339`

```
response = requests.get(
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

**Evidence:** `src/stata_mcp/data_info/spss.py:51`

```
resp = requests.get(str(self.data_path))
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

```
with urlopen(request, timeout=5) as response:
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### LOW (1)
#### MCP-SG-PY-006: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Evidence:** `src/stata_mcp/evaluate/_model.py:15`

```
api_key=<redacted:secret>"OPENAI_API_KEY"),
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.


## Recommended Policy
- Block by default; do not connect to developer workstations or production agents without review.
- Pin exact package versions in the startup command.

## Disclaimer
> MCP Trust provides evidence-based risk assessment. It does not guarantee that a server is safe or malicious. Use results as input to security review, sandboxing and policy decisions.
