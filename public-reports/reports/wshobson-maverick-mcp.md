# MCP Trust Report: github:wshobson/maverick-mcp

**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 40/100  
**Confidence:** 67%

_Resolved ref: `88bef247aa490a9f7fd363dfa435444edb69e2d2`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 40 falls in MEDIUM band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-META-003

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — scripts/load_tiingo_data.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

A caller-controlled module name can load and execute arbitrary code.

**Evidence:** `scripts/validate_setup.py:20`

```
__import__(module_name)
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled module name can load and execute arbitrary code.

**Remediation:** Import modules by static names; never import a computed module path.

**Remediation:** Import modules by static names; never import a computed module path.

#### MCP-META-003: Suspicious data-exfiltration phrase in metadata
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata references sending data/credentials to an external destination. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — tools/check_orchestration_config.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tools/check_orchestration_config.py`

```
Copy .env.example to .env and configure required API keys.
```

**Impact:** Instruction-like text in server-controlled metadata can steer the model without user awareness.

**Remediation:** Investigate where data would be sent. Block until the destination and intent are verified.

#### MCP-META-004: Metadata references system/developer prompt
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata references the system or developer prompt, a common prompt-injection target.

**Evidence:** `maverick_mcp/agents/base.py`

```
Build system prompt based on persona.
```

**Impact:** Instruction-like text in server-controlled metadata can steer the model without user awareness.

**Remediation:** Review why tool metadata references system-level prompts; treat as untrusted.

#### MCP-META-004: Metadata references system/developer prompt
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** metadata

```

**Impact:** Instruction-like text in server-controlled metadata can steer the model without user awareness.

**Remediation:** Review why tool metadata references system-level prompts; treat as untrusted.

#### MCP-SG-PY-004: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `maverick_mcp/api/routers/data.py:265`

```
resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — tests/integration/test_config_management.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/integration/test_config_management.py:192`

```
os.remove("test_integration.db")
```

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-META-005: Encoded or hidden content in metadata
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 65%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata contains zero-width/bidi control characters or long encoded payloads that can hide instructions. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — tests/integration/test_mcp_tools.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/integration/test_mcp_tools.py`

```

    async def test_optimization_tools_integration(self, setup_tools,
```

**Remediation:** Strip and inspect hidden/encoded content. Reject metadata containing zero-width or bidi control characters.

#### MCP-META-005: Encoded or hidden content in metadata
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 65%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata contains zero-width/bidi control characters or long encoded payloads that can hide instructions. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — tests/test_security_penetration.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/test_security_penetration.py`

```

**Remediation:** Strip and inspect hidden/encoded content. Reject metadata containing zero-width or bidi control characters.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access

The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Evidence:** `maverick_mcp/providers/market_data.py:61`

```

```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.
