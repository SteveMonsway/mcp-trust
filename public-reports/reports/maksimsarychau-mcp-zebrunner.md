# MCP Trust Report: github:maksimsarychau/mcp-zebrunner

**Decision:** BLOCK  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 39/100  
**Confidence:** 75%

_Resolved ref: `342683bd021c7ac9c9a2b886f66b62c4376e1a8b`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **high-confidence capability evidence in the server’s runtime code** (e.g. command execution). Review the flagged findings below before connecting this server to an agent. **A BLOCK is a "review required", not proof the server is malicious** — the evidence may be legitimate by design (see Decision Reasons).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 39 falls in MEDIUM band
- Critical finding with high confidence: MCP-CODE-002

## Findings (93)
### CRITICAL (1)
#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** critical  **Confidence:** 95%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `src/stealth-integrity.ts:140`

```
const remoteUrl = execSync('git remote get-url origin', {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

### HIGH (9)

### INFO (1)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-005: No security policy (SECURITY.md) found
**Severity:** info  **Confidence:** 100%  **Category:** supply_chain

The project does not provide a security policy. This is a maturity/best-practice gap, not a vulnerability — reported informational so it never drives the decision.

**Evidence:** `repo.files`

```
no SECURITY.md found in source
```

**Impact:** Absence of a disclosure process slows remediation of future vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:** Prefer projects that publish a SECURITY.md with a vulnerability disclosure process.
