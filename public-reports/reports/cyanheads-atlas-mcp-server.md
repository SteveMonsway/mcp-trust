# MCP Trust Report: github:cyanheads/atlas-mcp-server

**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 38/100  
**Confidence:** 69%

**Source:** [github.com/cyanheads/atlas-mcp-server](https://github.com/cyanheads/atlas-mcp-server)

_Resolved ref: `5a0bfdc08f9d0d106e69432bcaa606cc414340f1`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 38 falls in MEDIUM band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-CONFIG-005, MCP-CONFIG-005

## Findings (8)
### HIGH (2)
#### MCP-CONFIG-005: Secret embedded directly in MCP config
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 85%  **Category:** config

A config env value or header appears to contain a real secret rather than a runtime-injected reference.

**Evidence:** `mcp.json`

```
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
```

**Impact:** Committed secrets can be leaked via source control, reports, or shared configs.

**Remediation:** Do not hardcode secrets in config. Inject them at runtime from a secrets manager or environment.

#### MCP-CONFIG-005: Secret embedded directly in MCP config
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 65%  **Category:** config

A config env value or header appears to contain a real secret rather than a runtime-injected reference.

**Evidence:** `mcp.json`

```
NEO4J_PASSWORD=<redacted:secret>
```

**Impact:** Committed secrets can be leaked via source control, reports, or shared configs.

**Remediation:** Do not hardcode secrets in config. Inject them at runtime from a secrets manager or environment.

### MEDIUM (5)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `scripts/fetch-openapi-spec.ts:227`

```
await fs.writeFile(yamlOutputPath, yaml.dump(openapiSpec), "utf8");
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `scripts/fetch-openapi-spec.ts:238`

```
await fs.writeFile(
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `scripts/tree.ts:286`

```
await fs.writeFile(resolvedOutputFile, finalContent);
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `scripts/fetch-openapi-spec.ts:77`

```
const response = await axios.get(url, {
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `scripts/fetch-openapi-spec.ts:88`

if (axios.isAxiosError(error)) {
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### INFO (1)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-005: No security policy (SECURITY.md) found
**Severity:** info  **Confidence:** 100%  **Category:** supply_chain

The project does not provide a security policy. This is a maturity/best-practice gap, not a vulnerability — reported informational so it never drives the decision.

**Evidence:** `repo.files`

```
no SECURITY.md found in source
```

**Impact:** Absence of a disclosure process slows remediation of future vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:** Prefer projects that publish a SECURITY.md with a vulnerability disclosure process.


## Recommended Policy
- Run only in a sandbox with least-privilege configuration.
- Move secrets out of config into a secrets manager or environment injected at runtime.

## Disclaimer
> MCP Trust provides evidence-based risk assessment. It does not guarantee that a server is safe or malicious. Use results as input to security review, sandboxing and policy decisions.
