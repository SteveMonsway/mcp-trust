# MCP Trust Report: github:ariadng/metatrader-mcp-server

**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 32/100  
**Confidence:** 80%

_Resolved ref: `bd2ff591e32cb492fafefe74221d502dd78b71ef`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 32 falls in MEDIUM band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004

## Findings (18)
### LOW (18)
#### MCP-CODE-004: Python shell execution (subprocess shell=True / os.system)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Runs a subprocess through a shell (shell=True) or via os.system, enabling command injection. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — tests/metatrader_client/test_account.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/metatrader_client/test_account.py:9`

```
os.system('cls')
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use subprocess with a list of arguments and shell=False; never pass untrusted input to a shell.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — tests/metatrader_client/test_order.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/metatrader_client/test_order.py:291`

```
with open(filepath, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `src/metatrader_mcp/cli.py:20`

```
os.environ["password"] = password
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.
