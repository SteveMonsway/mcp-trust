## Findings (12)
### HIGH (2)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `lib/cache.js:128`

```
await fs.rm(this.config.cacheDirectory, { recursive: true, force: true });
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `lib/sqlite-cache.js:394`

```
await fs.rm(this.config.cacheDirectory, { recursive: true, force: true });
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### MEDIUM (7)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — scripts/clear-cache.js — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `scripts/clear-cache.js:22`

```
await fs.rm(cacheDir, { recursive: true, force: true });
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-005: Arbitrary filesystem read
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Reads files using a dynamically constructed path, allowing reads outside the intended scope.

**Evidence:** `features/index-codebase.js:305`

```
const content = await fs.readFile(file, "utf-8");
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled path can read sensitive files via path traversal. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Resolve and validate paths against an allowlisted base directory before reading.

#### MCP-CODE-005: Arbitrary filesystem read
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Reads files using a dynamically constructed path, allowing reads outside the intended scope.

**Evidence:** `features/index-codebase.js:488`

```
const content = await fs.readFile(file, "utf-8");
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled path can read sensitive files via path traversal. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Resolve and validate paths against an allowlisted base directory before reading.

#### MCP-CODE-005: Arbitrary filesystem read
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Reads files using a dynamically constructed path, allowing reads outside the intended scope.

**Evidence:** `features/index-codebase.js:638`

```
const content = await fs.readFile(file, "utf-8");
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled path can read sensitive files via path traversal. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Resolve and validate paths against an allowlisted base directory before reading.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `lib/cache.js:67`

```
fs.writeFile(cacheFile, JSON.stringify(this.vectorStore, null, 2)),
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `lib/cache.js:68`

```
fs.writeFile(hashFile, JSON.stringify(Object.fromEntries(this.fileHashes), null, 2))
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `features/check-last-version.js:171`

```
return await fetch(url, options);
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### LOW (2)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — test/better-sqlite3.test.js — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `test/better-sqlite3.test.js:42`

```
fs.unlinkSync(testDbPath);
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — test/helpers.js — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `test/helpers.js:81`

```
await fs.rm(config.cacheDirectory, { recursive: true, force: true });
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### INFO (1)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-005: No security policy (SECURITY.md) found
**Severity:** info  **Confidence:** 100%  **Category:** supply_chain

The project does not provide a security policy. This is a maturity/best-practice gap, not a vulnerability — reported informational so it never drives the decision.

**Evidence:** `repo.files`

```
no SECURITY.md found in source
```

**Impact:** Absence of a disclosure process slows remediation of future vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:** Prefer projects that publish a SECURITY.md with a vulnerability disclosure process.


## Recommended Policy
- Run only in a sandbox with least-privilege configuration.

## Disclaimer
> MCP Trust provides evidence-based risk assessment. It does not guarantee that a server is safe or malicious. Use results as input to security review, sandboxing and policy decisions.
