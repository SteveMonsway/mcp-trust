# MCP Trust Report: github:harishsg993010/damn-vulnerable-MCP-server

**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 41/100  
**Confidence:** 76%

_Resolved ref: `79734c19f5104cd11486c90926d245560f53befa`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 41 falls in MEDIUM band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004, MCP-CODE-004
