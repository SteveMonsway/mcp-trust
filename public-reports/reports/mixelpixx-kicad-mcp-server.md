**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 35/100  
**Confidence:** 76%

_Resolved ref: `693da5f875409ef8a20cfd2d808135b8ad82ee7b`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## Decision Reasons

## Findings (71)
### HIGH (21)
#### MCP-CODE-001: child_process.exec usage
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses child_process.exec(), which runs a command through a shell and is prone to command injection.

**Evidence:** `src/server.ts:364`

```
exec(
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false, and validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-CODE-001: child_process.exec usage
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses child_process.exec(), which runs a command through a shell and is prone to command injection.

**Evidence:** `src/server.ts:419`

```
exec(
```

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `python/commands/jlcsearch.py:51`

```
response = requests.get(url, params=params, timeout=30)
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### LOW (15)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 85%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — tests/test_wire_junction_changes.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/test_wire_junction_changes.py:449`

```
shutil.rmtree(path.parent, ignore_errors=True)
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-005: Arbitrary filesystem read
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Reads files using a dynamically constructed path, allowing reads outside the intended scope. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — tests/test_wire_junction_changes.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/test_wire_junction_changes.py:42`

```
with open(path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled path can read sensitive files via path traversal. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Resolve and validate paths against an allowlisted base directory before reading.

**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — tests/test_autoroute_best_of_n.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/test_autoroute_best_of_n.py:50`

```
with open(dsn_path, "w") as f:
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Evidence:** `tests/test_rotate_schematic_mirror.py:256`

```
with open(sch_path, "w") as f:
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-META-005: Encoded or hidden content in metadata
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 65%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata contains zero-width/bidi control characters or long encoded payloads that can hide instructions. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — tests/test_create_project_paths.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/test_create_project_paths.py`

```
C:/<redacted:high-entropy>
```

**Impact:** Hidden or encoded content can smuggle instructions past human review.

**Remediation:** Strip and inspect hidden/encoded content. Reject metadata containing zero-width or bidi control characters.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `scripts/generate_tool_annotations.py:477`

```
api_key = <redacted:secret>"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-META-002: Suspicious concealment phrase in metadata
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata instructs the model to hide actions from the user (e.g. "do not tell the user", "silently"). (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — tests/test_schematic_component_properties.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/test_schematic_component_properties.py`

```
The pre-existing delete path used the same buggy symbol-lookup
        regex and would silently report 'not found' for (lib_name)-first
        symbols. Verify it can now locate and remove them.
```

**Impact:** Instruction-like text in server-controlled metadata can steer the model without user awareness.

**Remediation:** Any instruction to hide behavior from the user is a strong tool-poisoning signal; do not connect without review.

#### MCP-SG-PY-006: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Evidence:** `python/commands/jlcpcb.py:50`

```
self.access_key = <redacted:secret> or os.getenv("JLCPCB_API_KEY")
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-SG-PY-006: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Evidence:** `python/commands/jlcpcb.py:51`

```
self.secret_key = <redacted:secret> or os.getenv("JLCPCB_API_SECRET")
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

### INFO (1)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-005: No security policy (SECURITY.md) found
**Severity:** info  **Confidence:** 100%  **Category:** supply_chain

The project does not provide a security policy. This is a maturity/best-practice gap, not a vulnerability — reported informational so it never drives the decision.

**Evidence:** `repo.files`

```
no SECURITY.md found in source
```

**Impact:** Absence of a disclosure process slows remediation of future vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:** Prefer projects that publish a SECURITY.md with a vulnerability disclosure process.
