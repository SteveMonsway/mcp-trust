# MCP Trust Report: github:FR0ZON3/notion-mcp

**Decision:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 36/100  
**Confidence:** 86%

_Resolved ref: `3a2ab379fe6452a57a664858c891345abd670f2d`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **notable capabilities or patterns worth a human look** (listed under Decision Reasons and Findings). **This is not a rejection** — read the specific findings and decide based on your threat model. Many are expected for what the server does (e.g. network access for a fetch server).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 36 falls in MEDIUM band
- Elevated to NEEDS_REVIEW by: MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002

## Findings (28)
### MEDIUM (7)
#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — scripts/bench/lib/mcp-client.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `scripts/bench/lib/mcp-client.ts:150`

```
const child = spawn(spec.command, spec.args, {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — scripts/bench/lib/provision.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `scripts/bench/lib/provision.ts:131`

```
const child = spawn(command, args, {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — scripts/bench/token-compare.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `scripts/bench/token-compare.ts:183`

```
const child = spawn(options.command, options.args, {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — scripts/bench/token-compare.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `scripts/bench/token-compare.ts:308`

```
const child = spawn(command, args, {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — scripts/release/postpublish-smoke.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `scripts/release/postpublish-smoke.ts:205`

```
const child = spawn("npm", args, { stdio: ["ignore", "pipe", "pipe"] });
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — scripts/release/postpublish-smoke.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `scripts/release/postpublish-smoke.ts:247`

```
const child = spawn("node", [serverPath], {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-META-005: Encoded or hidden content in metadata
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 65%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata contains zero-width/bidi control characters or long encoded payloads that can hide instructions.

**Evidence:** `scripts/test-file-upload.ts`

```
<redacted:high-entropy>==
```

**Impact:** Hidden or encoded content can smuggle instructions past human review.

**Remediation:** Strip and inspect hidden/encoded content. Reject metadata containing zero-width or bidi control characters.

### LOW (21)
#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — tests/bench/harness/runner.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/bench/harness/runner.ts:286`

```
const value = execSync(command, {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — tests/e2e/helpers/run-context.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `scripts/bench/db-axis.ts:494`

```
const notionToken = <redacted:secret>
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.
