## Findings (23)
### HIGH (2)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `meta_ads_mcp/core/auth.py:314`

```
os.remove(cache_path)
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `meta_ads_mcp/core/pipeboard_auth.py:423`

```
os.remove(cache_path)
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### MEDIUM (5)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `meta_ads_mcp/core/ads.py:1217`

```
with open(filepath, "wb") as f:
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `meta_ads_mcp/core/auth.py:220`

```
with open(cache_path, "w") as f:
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `meta_ads_mcp/core/pipeboard_auth.py:236`

```
with open(cache_path, "w") as f:
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-SG-PY-004: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `meta_ads_mcp/core/pipeboard_auth.py:263`

```
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers)
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

#### MCP-SG-PY-004: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `meta_ads_mcp/core/pipeboard_auth.py:337`

```
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### LOW (16)
#### MCP-META-005: Encoded or hidden content in metadata
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 65%  **Category:** metadata

Metadata contains zero-width/bidi control characters or long encoded payloads that can hide instructions. (Severity reduced medium→low: this match is in test code — tests/test_get_ad_image_quality_improvements.py — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `tests/test_get_ad_image_quality_improvements.py`

```
https://external.fbsb6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/13476424677788553381?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fads%2Fimage%2F%3Fd%<redacted:high-entropy>
```

**Impact:** Hidden or encoded content can smuggle instructions past human review.

**Remediation:** Strip and inspect hidden/encoded content. Reject metadata containing zero-width or bidi control characters.

#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `examples/example_http_client.py:126`

```
pipeboard_token = <redacted:secret>"PIPEBOARD_API_TOKEN")
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.
