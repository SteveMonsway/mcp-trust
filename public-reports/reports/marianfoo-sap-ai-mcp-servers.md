_Resolved ref: `7223b929a7e5a39ce4401e4f121c254798dc833b`_

## Executive Summary
No significant risks were detected in the available evidence. **This is not a safety guarantee** — standard review still applies, and see Coverage/Limitations for what was and wasn’t assessed.

## Decision Reasons

## Findings (7)
### MEDIUM (5)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→medium: this match is in build/dev-tooling code — scripts/enrich-data.mjs — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `scripts/enrich-data.mjs:478`

```
await fs.writeFile(OUTPUT_PATH, `${JSON.stringify(output, null, 2)}\n`, 'utf8');
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `scripts/render-readme.mjs:146`

```
await fs.writeFile(README_PATH, rendered.trimEnd() + '\n', 'utf8');
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-SG-JS-006: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

The server handles credentials; misuse or logging could leak them.

**Evidence:** `scripts/enrich-data.mjs:394`

```
const authToken = <redacted:secret> || process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN || token;
```

**Impact:** The server handles credentials; misuse or logging could leak them.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-SG-JS-006: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

The server handles credentials; misuse or logging could leak them.

**Evidence:** `scripts/enrich-data.mjs:394`

```
const authToken = <redacted:secret> || process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN || token;
```

**Impact:** The server handles credentials; misuse or logging could leak them.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `scripts/enrich-data.mjs:356`

```
const res = await fetch(url, {
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

### LOW (1)
#### MCP-CODE-007: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

Reads environment variables whose names imply secrets (tokens, keys, passwords). Reading credentials from the environment is normal configuration; this is an informational capability signal, not a vulnerability by itself.

**Evidence:** `scripts/enrich-data.mjs:20`

```
const token = <redacted:secret> || process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN || '';
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.

### INFO (1)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-005: No security policy (SECURITY.md) found
**Severity:** info  **Confidence:** 100%  **Category:** supply_chain

The project does not provide a security policy. This is a maturity/best-practice gap, not a vulnerability — reported informational so it never drives the decision.

**Evidence:** `repo.files`

```
no SECURITY.md found in source
```

**Impact:** Absence of a disclosure process slows remediation of future vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:** Prefer projects that publish a SECURITY.md with a vulnerability disclosure process.


## Recommended Policy
- No elevated restrictions required beyond standard review, based on available evidence.
