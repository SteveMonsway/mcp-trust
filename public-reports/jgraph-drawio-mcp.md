# MCP Trust Report: github:jgraph/drawio-mcp

**Decision:** BLOCK  
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Score:** 33/100  
**Confidence:** 85%

_Resolved ref: `82ab91e327566e0369dbe4ba2a1b2eeed517fe59`_

## Executive Summary
The scanner found **high-confidence capability evidence in the server’s runtime code** (e.g. command execution). Review the flagged findings below before connecting this server to an agent. **A BLOCK is a "review required", not proof the server is malicious** — the evidence may be legitimate by design (see Decision Reasons).

## Decision Reasons
- Overall score 33 falls in MEDIUM band
- Critical finding with high confidence: MCP-CODE-002, MCP-CODE-002

## Findings (13)
### CRITICAL (2)
#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** critical  **Confidence:** 95%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `mcp-app-server/src/index.js:23`

```
sha = execSync("git rev-parse --short HEAD", { cwd: path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)), stdio: ["pipe", "pipe", "ignore"] }).toString().trim();
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** critical  **Confidence:** 95%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `mcp-app-server/src/index.js:27`

```
var status = execSync("git status --porcelain", { cwd: path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)), stdio: ["pipe", "pipe", "ignore"] }).toString().trim();
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

### HIGH (6)
#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `mcp-app-server/src/build-html.js:32`

```
sha = execSync("git rev-parse --short HEAD", { cwd: __dirname, stdio: ["pipe", "pipe", "ignore"] }).toString().trim();
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `mcp-app-server/src/build-html.js:36`

```
var status = execSync("git status --porcelain", { cwd: __dirname, stdio: ["pipe", "pipe", "ignore"] }).toString().trim();
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Evidence:** `mcp-tool-server/src/index.js:158`

```
child = spawn("cmd", ["/c", "start", "", tmpFile], { shell: false, stdio: "ignore" });
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Evidence:** `mcp-tool-server/src/index.js:167`

```
child = spawn("open", [url], { shell: false, stdio: "ignore" });
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Evidence:** `mcp-tool-server/src/index.js:171`

```
child = spawn("xdg-open", [url], { shell: false, stdio: "ignore" });
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Evidence:** `shape-search/generate-index.js:36`

```
return execFileSync("curl", ["-sL", "--fail", url], {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

### MEDIUM (5)
#### MCP-CODE-005: Arbitrary filesystem read
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 75%  **Category:** code

Reads files using a dynamically constructed path, allowing reads outside the intended scope.

**Evidence:** `mcp-app-server/src/index.js:55`

```
path.join(path.dirname(pakoEntry), "..", "dist", "pako_deflate.min.js"),
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled path can read sensitive files via path traversal. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Resolve and validate paths against an allowlisted base directory before reading.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `mcp-app-server/src/build-html.js:112`

```
fs.writeFileSync(outPath,
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `shape-search/generate-index.js:414`

```
fs.writeFileSync(outPath, JSON.stringify(deduplicated, null, 2));
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `mcp-app-server/src/libavoid-versions.js:33`

```
const res = await fetch(CDN_BASE + file,
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.

#### MCP-SG-JS-005: Outbound request with dynamic URL (SSRF / exfiltration)
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Evidence:** `mcp-tool-server/src/index.js:119`

```
const res = await fetch(SHAPE_INDEX_URL);
```

**Impact:** A caller-controlled URL can reach internal services or exfiltrate data. Note — almost every MCP server makes outbound requests; this is reported as evidence (medium) but does not by itself force NEEDS_REVIEW. Real SSRF needs the URL to come from tool input.

**Remediation:** Validate URLs against an allowlist of hosts/schemes before making outbound requests.


## Recommended Policy
- Block by default; do not connect to developer workstations or production agents without review.
