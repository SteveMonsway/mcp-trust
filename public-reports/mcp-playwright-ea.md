## Findings (10)
### HIGH (4)
#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `run-tests.cjs:5`

```
execSync('npx jest --no-cache --coverage --testMatch="<rootDir>/src/__tests__/**/*.test.ts"', { stdio: 'inherit' });
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-CODE-002: Synchronous shell execution (execSync / spawnSync shell)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Uses execSync (or spawnSync with shell:true), executing a command through a shell synchronously.

**Evidence:** `run-tests.js:5`

```
const output = execSync('npx jest --no-cache --coverage', { encoding: 'utf8' });
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution.

**Remediation:** Prefer spawnSync with an argument array and shell:false; validate inputs.

#### MCP-SG-JS-001: Shell command execution (child_process.exec/execSync)
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 90%  **Category:** code

Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Evidence:** `src/toolHandler.ts:168`

```
const installProcess = spawn('npx', ['playwright', 'install', browserType], {
```

**Impact:** Enables arbitrary shell command execution with the process privileges.

**Remediation:** Use execFile/spawn with an argument array and shell:false; validate against an allowlist.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** high  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `src/logging/logger.ts:279`

```
fs.unlinkSync(oldFile); // Delete oldest file
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### MEDIUM (2)
#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `src/logging/logger.ts:234`

```
fs.appendFileSync(this.config.filePath, message + '\n', 'utf8');
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** medium  **Confidence:** 70%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace.

**Evidence:** `src/tools/codegen/index.ts:117`

```
await fs.writeFile(result.filePath, result.testCode, 'utf-8');
```

**Impact:** File writes can modify data; a dynamic path can write outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

### LOW (4)
#### MCP-SUPPLY-005: No security policy (SECURITY.md) found
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 100%  **Category:** supply_chain

The project does not provide a security policy, indicating weaker security maturity/disclosure process.

**Evidence:** `repo.files`

```
no SECURITY.md found in source
```

**Impact:** Absence of a disclosure process slows remediation of future vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:** Prefer projects that publish a SECURITY.md with a vulnerability disclosure process.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 85%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — src/__tests__/codegen.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/__tests__/codegen.test.ts:83`

```
files.map(file => fs.unlink(path.join(TEST_CONFIG.OUTPUT_DIR, file)))
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory. The argument appears to be dynamically constructed, raising injection risk.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — src/__tests__/logging.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/__tests__/logging.test.ts:16`

```
fs.rmSync(testLogDir, { recursive: true, force: true });
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.

#### MCP-CODE-006: Arbitrary filesystem write or delete
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 80%  **Category:** code

Writes or deletes files, potentially outside a scoped workspace. (Severity reduced high→low: this match is in test code — src/__tests__/logging.test.ts — which does not run as part of the MCP server.)

**Evidence:** `src/__tests__/logging.test.ts:23`

```
fs.rmSync(testLogDir, { recursive: true, force: true });
```

**Impact:** File deletion can destroy data outside the intended directory.

**Remediation:** Constrain writes/deletes to a validated workspace directory; never delete based on unvalidated input.
