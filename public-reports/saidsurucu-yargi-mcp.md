## Findings (7)
### LOW (7)
#### MCP-SG-PY-006: Secret-like environment variable access
**Severity:** low  **Confidence:** 60%  **Category:** code

The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Evidence:** `bddk_mcp_module/client.py:41`

```
self.tavily_api_key = <redacted:secret>"TAVILY_API_KEY")
```

**Impact:** The server reads credentials from the environment (credential_access capability); normal configuration, a concern only if they are logged or sent externally.

**Remediation:** Confirm the server needs these secrets; scope tokens narrowly and never log them.
